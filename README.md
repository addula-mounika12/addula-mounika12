<h1>Hi, I'm Mounika Addula!</h1>
<h3>Cybersecurity Professional | IAM Enthusiast | Bug Hunter & Ethical Hacker</h3>

<p>
I'm a cybersecurity professional committed to redefining how digital identities are secured, governed, and empowered in today‚Äôs hyperconnected world. Grounded in the principles of <strong>zero trust</strong>, <strong>automation</strong>, and <strong>access transparency</strong>, I bring a mission-driven mindset to protecting what matters most: <em>people, data, and trust</em>.
</p>

<p>
I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Information Technology and Management from <strong>The University of Texas at Dallas</strong>, with a concentration in Identity & Access Management (IAM) and Identity Governance & Administration (IGA). My focus is on securing user access across cloud and hybrid environments while aligning identity architecture with organizational goals and compliance mandates.
</p>

<p>
I‚Äôm drawn to security challenges where precision matters where security must enable, not obstruct. From automating onboarding and enforcing least privilege, to identifying misconfigurations and preparing for audits, I aim to deliver <strong>seamless, scalable, and secure identity solutions</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Curious by nature and structured in execution, I thrive in environments that value <strong>clarity</strong>, <strong>resilience</strong>, and <strong>long-term thinking</strong>.
